Description: Comprehensive toolkit for chi-squared analysis of contingency tables.
    Includes five analytical facilities: (1) Chi-squared testing with traditional,
    (N-1)/N adjusted, permutation, Monte Carlo, and M test (maximum adjusted residual)
    methods; (2) Post-hoc analysis with cell-level metrics including standardised
    residuals, moment-corrected standardised residuals, adjusted standardised residuals,
    Quetelet Index, IJ association factor, backwards-stepping outlier detection, PEM
    with bootstrap confidence intervals, median polish residuals (standardised and
    adjusted), Goodman-Kruskal residuals, and Difference in Estimated Proportions (DEP);
    (3) Association measures with over 20 coefficients organised by statistical
    foundation, including chi-squared-based, margin-free, and PRE measures;
    (4) Hierarchical clustering using Ward's method with chi-squared distance and
    significance testing; (5) Stratified analysis with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test
    for conditional independence and log-linear homogeneity test, supporting any
    R x C table dimensions. Features toggleable method explanations with rationale
    and usage guidance, automatic significance highlighting, forest and trajectory
    plots, diagnostic decision trees, and proper academic citations.
