  Comprehensive toolkit for chi-squared analysis of contingency tables. Includes
  five analytical facilities: (1) Chi-squared testing with traditional, (N-1)/N
  adjusted, permutation, and Monte Carlo methods; (2) Post-hoc analysis with
  eight cell-level metrics including standardised residuals, adjusted
  standardised residuals, Quetelet Index, IJ association factor, PEM with
  bootstrap confidence intervals, and median polish residuals; (3) Association
  measures with over 20 coefficients organised by statistical foundation; (4)
  Hierarchical clustering using Ward's method with chi-squared distance; (5)
  Stratified analysis of 2x2 tables with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for
  conditional independence and Mantel-Haenszel and Breslow-Day-Tarone tests for
  homogeneity of odds ratios. Features toggleable method explanations, automatic
  significance highlighting, and proper academic citations.
